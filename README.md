# Career Landing (UI/UX Design Concept)

## Overview

Career Landing is a UI/UX design concept for a career-focused social platform. The primary goal of this platform is to bridge the gap between education and the professional world, acting as a "LinkedIn" specifically for students and recent graduates.

The platform is designed to help emerging talent find internships, entry-level job opportunities, and connect with companies looking to hire them.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the visual design assets and high-fidelity mockups for the Career Landing project. All designs were created in **Figma**.

*(This repo does not contain source code, only the exported images.)*

## Key Features (Visualized)

The designs in this repository showcase the following core features:

* **Student-Centric Profiles:** Profiles focused on academic projects, coursework, and skills rather than extensive work history.
* **Targeted Job Search:** A dedicated search engine tailored mostly for internships and entry level positions.
* **Application Tracking:** A dashboard for users to manage their job applications.
* **Community Feed:** A space for university news, career advice, professional connections and personalized job postings.
* **AI Mockup Interview:** A feature allowing users to practice their interview skills with an AI, simulated through an avatar videocall interface.
